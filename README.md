# ðŸ“¦ Pull Request Templates

This repository uses custom **Pull Request (PR) templates** to standardize and streamline collaboration.

### ðŸ§¾ Where are they located?

All PR templates live inside:

.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/


- `bug_fix.md` â†’ For bug fixes and patches
- `feature.md` â†’ For new features or enhancements
- `hotfix.md` â†’ For urgent production fixes

---

### ðŸ”„ How It Works

When someone creates a new PR, GitHub will automatically show a **dropdown** to select one of these templates.

Once selected, the chosen template will pre-fill the PR description to guide the contributor.

> This helps maintain clarity, reduce review time, and ensure consistency across changes.
